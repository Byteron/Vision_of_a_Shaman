#	A short list of easter eggs or other hidden goodies in this campaign
#	Some are old, some are new, some are secret, and some are well-known
#	Something counts as a hidden goodie if the effect is not advertised or must be discovered somehow
#	The list doesn't include any of the "pop-up" monsters, which are at best annoying
#	- if you defeat Tazgosh before Krogo, you can defeat both. In that case, there will be no fight in "Homecoming"
#	- TODO: if you keep Dorin alive until the end of "Siege of Antoria" Mordin will give you additional 100G
